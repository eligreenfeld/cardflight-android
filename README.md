CardFlight's Android SDK Library
=================

Introduction
------------

The CardFlight iOS SDK is used to process card present and card not-present transactions in your Android application.

CardFlight's SDK is based around keeping it as simple as possible while keeping the highest level of [security](https://developers.getcardflight.com/help/security) at the forefront of all that we do. Take out the pain of PCI-compliance when building your app.

Authentication is done through your API Keys and processing is done through the Account Tokens. All connections to CardFlight's API are done through HTTPS over HSTS.
